# Open Water Foundation / GeoProcessor (for Developers) #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to develop the
Open Water Foundation (OWF) GeoProcessor software,
which automates processing spatial data.  See also:

* Latest [GeoProcessor User Documentation](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/latest/doc-user/)
* [GeoProcessor download website](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/geoprocessor/)

**The GeoProcessor software is under development as an open source software project at the Open Water Foundation.
Although significant progress has been made, it is expected that significant changes may occur in the
near future as primary features are added.**

This documentation is intended for GeoProcessor developers that have (or would like to develop) experience with Python,
QGIS Python libraries, and Python development environment.
The PyCharm Community Edition software is used by the Open Water Foundation as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
although other tools could be used.
PyCharm project files are not included in the repository and it should be possible to use other development tools.

The primary development environment at the Open Water Foundation
is currently Windows 10 using the latest stable QGIS 3.x release.
The primary deployment environments are Windows 10, Cygwin, and Ubuntu/Debian Linux.
A QGIS-based `gp` distribution is available on Windows for geospatial processing.

A non-QGIS `gptest` distribution was also created
in order to use the GeoProcessor workflow as a function test framework.
However, this effort is likely to be downscaled as effort focuses on the main GeoProcessor product.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources, so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF also works to advance open data tools.
The GeoProcessor, which focuses on spatial data processing,
complements the TSTool software, which focuses on time series data processing.
These tools can be used to analyze complex water and land issues.
