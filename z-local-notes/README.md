# z-local-notes #

This folder contains local developer notes, for example whether the repo was checked out using cygwin,
Git Bash, etc., which impacts how file permissions and line endings are handled.

The files are NOT committed to the repository, other than this README and the `.gitignore` file.

DO NOT modify this `README.md` with individual developer notes - create other files as needed.
